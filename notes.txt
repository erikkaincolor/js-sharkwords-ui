PREMISE:

given a random word. 
find the value of that word by guessing the letters
If you guess a letter thatâ€™s not in the word, 
sharks will begin to enter the screen so be careful! 

If you make 5 wrong guesses, the sharks will attack!

################################################################
 what happens when you guess a word successfully? 
 -"congrats! you win!, click here to play again"
 
 What happens when you canâ€™t guess the word? 
 -"picture changes of sharks getting closer to person, letters get greyed out"
 
 Also since you will be building the user interface in this first part, 
 focus on what the components of the page are. 
 -"letters, pictures, spaces for where each letter should show itself if a letter is guessed correctly for a particular word" 
 
 What things are similar and probably have the same CSS properties?
 -gif image that changes as wrong guesses are made
 -26 white buttins with same font and same size
-"The shark got you! Click here to play again." <---LINK
-"Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You won!" <---LINK
